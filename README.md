# fourier-feature-optimization-of-MLP
- Implemented the approach of **fourier feature mapping** of input feature space comprising of **high frequency functions in low dimentional domains** to make to convergence of MLPs **exponentially** faster without sacrificing the accuracy of the model.

- Also made the comparisions of the effects of varius distributions of the feature transformations on the training and validation loss.
